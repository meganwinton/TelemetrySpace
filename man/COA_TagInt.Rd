\arguments{
\item{nind}{Number of tagged individuals}

\item{nrec}{Number of receivers}

\item{ntime}{Number of time steps}

\item{ntest}{Number of test tags}

\item{ntrans}{Number of expected transmissions per tag per time interval}

\item{test}{Array of test tag detection data, where row = individual tag, column = receiver, and matrix = time step}

\item{recX}{Receiver coordinates in the east-west direction (should be projected and scaled for computational efficiency)}

\item{recY}{Receiver coordinates in the north-south direction (should be projected and scaled for computational efficiency)}

\item{xlim}{East-west boundaries of spatial extent (receiver array + buffer)}

\item{ylim}{North-south boundaries of spatial extent (receiver array + buffer)}

\item{testX}{Test tag coordinates in the east-west direction (should be projected and scaled for computational efficiency)}

\item{testY}{Test tag coordinates in the north-south direction (should be projected and scaled for computational efficiency)}
}
\value{
COA_TagInt_Bayes returns an object of class `stanfit` returned by `rstan::sampling`. See the 'rstan' package documentation for details.

This function returns a list containing the following components: 1) a summary of the detection function parameters; 2) the time required for model fitting; 3) time-varying detection probabilites for each receiver; 4) the estimated COAs for each individual in each time step and 95 percent credible interval; and 5) a dataframe containing values for each parameter and latent parameter from chain iterations. These can be used to plot posterior distributions and the credible interval around each estimated COA.

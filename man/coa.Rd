\usage{
coa(n_ind, n_rec, n_time, n_trans, det, rec_x, rec_y, lim_x, lim_y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_ind}{Number of tagged individuals}

\item{n_rec}{Number of receivers}

\item{n_time}{Number of time steps}

\item{n_trans}{Number of expected transmissions per tag per time interval}

\item{det}{Array of detection data, where row = individual, column = receiver, and matrix = time step}

\item{rec_x}{Receiver coordinates in the east-west direction (should be projected and scaled for computational efficiency)}

\item{rec_y}{Receiver coordinates in the north-south direction (should be projected and scaled for computational efficiency)}

\item{lim_x}{East-west boundaries of spatial extent (receiver array + buffer)}

\item{lim_y}{North-south boundaries of spatial extent (receiver array + buffer)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{sampling} from \code{rstan}.
This can include setting \code{chains}, \code{iter}, \code{warmup}, and \code{control}. Please see
\code{rstan::sampling} for more info.}
}
\value{
\code{coa()} returns an object of class \code{stanfit} returned by \code{rstan::sampling}. See the \code{rstan} package documentation for details.

This function returns a list containing the following components: 1) a summary of the detection function parameters; 2) the time required for model fitting; 3) the estimated COAs for each individual in each time step and 95 percent credible interval; and 4) a dataframe containing values for each parameter and latent parameter from chain iterations. These can be used to plot posterior distributions and the credible interval around each estimated COA.
